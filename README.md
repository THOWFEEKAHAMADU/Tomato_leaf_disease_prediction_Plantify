Tomato is a food-rich plant,a consumable vegetable widely cultivated. Worldwide, there are approximately 160 million tons of tomatoes consumed annually. Tomato dedmand is also increasing as a result of its widespread use. According to statistics,small farmers produce more than 80% of agricultural output;due to disease and pests,about 50% of their crops are lost.

Leaf disease detection is important for identifying the profit and loss on production. Here deep learning technique is used to detect the leaf disease which contains a healthy leaves collection with nine different leaf disease and twenty-two thousand leaves images grouped as train,test and validation are used.The stages involved in the entire system are Image collection,Preprocessing,Detection of plant disease in the image and Recognition of those detected disease and provide suggestion accordingly.

This project covers the Plant disease prediction system,which consists of a classification phase using resnet34 model to identify the content of the diseased leaf based on the input image.
